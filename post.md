# Texture Blog Devlog#1
---
I somehow managed to make this whole website into existence, To be very frank i never thought I'll make
a blog / chatroom kind of thingy. It's just what got into me, Like i wanted to make my portfolio for a
vey long time but i never thought That I will do it i mean hey why will someone want to add a freaking 
chatroom in their __Portfolio__ but somehow i did it *sobs in no life*, But yeah dude it somehow
became a reality and in this series of posts I guess I'll just blog my journey of how i made this.

## Step 1: Make uncountable number of folders which you might not even use
So i started by making a lot of structured folders like A LOTTTTT, And most of them are because i wanted
to over-engineer this project, Like I wanted it to be like a lot structured even tho it'll just be a
personal project the main reason for this being that I wanted to get an experience of a big project

## Step 2: Write something i don't really know what i did actually
Bro at this point i just spinned a server from express js, Matter fact i didn't even used typescript in
this project the main reason being that, I was already exhausted by the amount of folders i created ðŸ˜­
And yeah i just added some files wrote something i don't know and i don't even care at this point ðŸ’€
But yeah i had a server spinned up

## Step 3: Use create-next-app because that's literally what every cool kid is using now
So i used create-next-app because well yeah. And it's actually my first time using Nextjs in a big project.
And to be real i like how easy it is to get the routing working I really love the routing system, But I'm
not a big fan of the native state management system maybe it's because i didn't used any third party 
state management framework. But i just don't like the whole react state management ecosystem it's very hard
to setup although I'm pretty sure it's like a down slide from there onwards, But me being me chosed to not 
use any framework because of the extra setup you have to do and i use HOCs now

## Step 4: I don't know just start making the thing?!?!?!
Yeah so after this i guess i implemented the OAuth first and to make it work with nextjs omfg, I will never
forget how troublesome it was to implement OAuth using HOCs or maybe it's just because it's my first time
using Next idrk but yeah, I fw the next framework in general tho :D and as for the server I guess I'll use
PM2 too because I feel like the OAuth thingy is pretty weird and takes time so I'll try to optimize it as
much as i can

## Step 5: Stop everything and get tensed about JEE
Yay JEE on it's way and the sudden realisation that I haven't realised 11th syllabus I'll legit kms ðŸ™‚

```js
for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++){
  console.log(btoa('SSB3YW5uYSBkaWU='))
};
```
